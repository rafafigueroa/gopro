{Abstract}
{Introduction}
There is a need for secure point-to-point communication between robots. The purpose of this project is to create a system to allow secure, point-to-point, communications between the pairs of robots. Laser systems have been used for point to point communications. {Nasa based} {Air force systems}. These systems use large, powerful, lasers and servos to achieve high preicision. The goal of this project is to develop a system that will allow two agents to communicate over a laser beam in the lab, using inexpensive components.

{Methodology}
The system is composed of the following blocks:
	Gimbal 
	Laser, Photodiode, and encoder/decoder board
	Camera
	Processor Board
	Agent

Gimbal
The Gimbal system is a custom designed 2 axis system. It uses Polulu Micro Metal DC motors with a 300:1 gear ration to control the direction and orientation of the camera, laser, and receiver. The Gimbal allows for 360 degree rotation about the Z axis and +/- 15 degree rotation about the Y axis. The motors are powered from a 12 Volt switching regulator and controlled from a dedicated Polulu <blah> dual motor controller. The controller interfaces to the Processor by means of two DAC channels. Signals for the laser, Signal Good indicator, photodiode, and USB pass through a 12 wire slipring mounted to the bottom of the assembly.

Camera
The current camera is a GoPro Hero3+ capable of 12MP images with a 90 degree FOV. It transmitts images over an IP link to the CPU at approximatly four frames per second. The CPU uses openCV to process the images transmitted by the camera.

Laser Encoder / Decoder
The Laser Encoder / Decoder board on the initiating agent encodeds the message into laser pulses. The photodiode receives these pulses, using an Op Amp to reject levels below a settable threshold. Once the photodiode level rises above the threshold a Signal Good LED is actived to signal the proper alignment of the laser. The received pulses are amplified to a user determined voltage and passed to the Processor. 

Processor Board
An Intel Edison SOC was chosen for this project. The Edison provides a dual core Atom processor operating at 500 MHz and a 100 MHz <blah> processor. All external logic on the board operates at 1.8 volts. Power is provided by a USB OTG port and another USB port is provided for the console. It also provides on board 10bit DAC channels which are used as inputs to the Polulu motor controller. The Edison runs Debian Linux 3.6 with openCV. The control logic is written in Python.

{Description of Target Acquire Algorithm}
When operating, images are captured every 250 ms. They are transmitted by the GoPro as a Base64 encoded string. This string is decoded into binary values and put into a Numpy array. This array is converted to HSV values and image correction is applied to correct for image aberations from the GoPro camera. OpenCV's built in Sift algorithm is used to search for the target agent. Once identified a region of interest is created around the detected agent. The distance between the center of the image and the detected agent is used as an error term for the Gimbal control. Once this error approaches zero the image is monitored for the Signal Good indicator. An small error around the central region, in the form of a Levy Walk {citation needed}, is used to search for the precise alignment of the laser. Once the Signal Good indicator is detected motor movement ceases. The desired message is transmitted over the UART to the Laser Encoder / Decoder board. 

Agent
The agent current is a TurtleBot from Garage Systems <blah>. The interface to the Laser Communication Module is through the USB port on the Turtlebot computer. 12 Volts DC is provided by the base of the turtlebot and seperate regulators are used to provide power to the variouse modules. 

The communication protocol to the Laser Communication Module is composed of a header and various parameters as detailed below.

The Edison is powered from a switching power supply <blah>, drawing from the 12 Volts output available on the turtlebots. In addition a 5V regulator is used to provide main power to the Edison board, the Laser, and the Laser Encoder / Decoder.

{Describe how the Laser Encoder / Decoder works}
The laser is a standard laser pointer operating at 650? nm wavelength. The receiver is a standard photodiode <model> tuned to the same wavelength. The Laser Encoder / Decoder board drives the laser, amplifies the signal from the Photodiode, and  <blah>

{Gimbal System}
The Gimbal is a custom builts framework consisting of two DC motors and a slipring. The Z Motor {figure / picture} allows for 360 degrees of rotation about the Z axis while the Y motor allows for 15 degrees about the Y axis. The motors are Polulu Micro Metal motors with a 300:1 gear ratio operating at 12 VDC. They are controlled from a Polulu Motor Controller board mounted on the base of the Turtlebot. This is interfaced to the Edison through an DAC ports. The equations used to control the motors are as follows:

{Motor control equations}

The error term for the control equations is derived from the camera images. Once the target is identified the distance to the center of the image is calculated and this result is converted to millimeters. Once the image is centered the Signal Good LED is monitored to determine correct alignment. A small error input is used to cause oscillation about the center of the screen until the Signal Good LED is illuminated. At this point motor movement will cease and the signal is sent.
